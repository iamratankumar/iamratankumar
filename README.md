# Hello, I'm Ratan Kumar

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Tulsa with a strong background in software engineering. With a passion for coding, I've gained hands-on experience in a variety of technologies and have a particular interest in cybersecurity, network theory, and bioinformatics. I am a Teaching Assistant at The University of Tulsa, where I assist undergraduate students with Java classes and help them develop their programming skills and problem-solving abilities. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion for computer science with others, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools.

Furthermore,
I have a solid background in full stack development, machine learning, and web development, which I gained from my previous roles as an Associate Software Engineer and a Software Engineering Trainee at Northstar Technologies. There, I led a project that involved using JAVA J2EE, Spring Boot, Hibernate, React, Redux, RestAPI, and other technologies to create a web application for a client. I also trained three new hires within the company, and contributed to the debugging, testing, and deployment of the application. I have multiple certifications in HTML5, JavaScript, and PHP, and I am proficient in Python and C++. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at The University of Tulsa, after completing a MCs in Computer Science at Karachi University. My goal is to further enhance my skills and knowledge in computer science, and to apply them to real-world problems and solutions.
